# 📊 Customer Churn Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data using **Python and Power BI** to identify key factors influencing customer attrition.

The goal of this project is to:

* Understand customer behavior patterns
* Identify churn drivers
* Generate actionable insights
* Build an interactive dashboard for business decision-making

This project demonstrates strong skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dashboard development**.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer-level information such as:

* Customer demographics
* Subscription details
* Contract type
* Monthly charges
* Tenure
* Churn status

The dataset includes **7,000+ records** and multiple categorical and numerical features.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python**

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Power BI**
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**

---

## 🔍 Project Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

* Imported dataset using Pandas
* Checked data types and structure
* Verified missing values

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Handled missing/null values
* Removed duplicates
* Corrected inconsistent formatting
* Converted categorical variables
* Performed feature engineering (e.g., tenure grouping)

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Created histograms, box plots, and count plots
* Analyzed churn distribution
* Compared churn across:

  * Contract type
  * Payment method
  * Tenure
  * Monthly charges
* Generated correlation heatmaps

### 4️⃣ Data Preparation for Dashboard

* Exported cleaned dataset
* Structured data for Power BI
* Created calculated fields and measures

### 5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Development

* Built interactive dashboard
* Added slicers (Contract Type, Gender, Tenure, etc.)
* Created KPIs and churn rate metrics
* Designed visual insights for management-level reporting

---

## 📊 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* 📈 Overall Churn Rate
* 👥 Customer Segmentation
* 💰 Monthly Revenue Analysis
* 📅 Tenure vs Churn Trends
* 📊 Contract Type Comparison

The dashboard allows dynamic filtering and helps stakeholders quickly identify high-risk customer segments.

---

## 📈 Key Results & Insights

* Customers with **monthly contracts** showed higher churn rates.
* Customers with **low tenure** were more likely to churn.
* Higher monthly charges slightly increased churn probability.
* Long-term contract customers showed better retention.

These insights can help businesses improve customer retention strategies and reduce revenue loss.
